#### Perform

#####HTML

I have created a significant portion of my code using Bootstrap, which has provided me with a great deal of convenience. I began by establishing the necessary connections in the HTML section. Then, I created a menu on the page. However, the menus are not active. Subsequently, I created a registration form. I presented a form for the user to enter their first name, last name, select a company name, email, phone, and a subject. I made the form elements mandatory using the "required" attribute. I couldn't write JavaScript to validate the phone number, so instead, I wrote the area codes in Turkey in HTML, and I added a dropdown list for selection. I added a restriction for entering a maximum of 7 digits for the phone number. For the "Are you a beginner?" question, I added two radio buttons for the user to choose from, with both buttons initially selected. Users can select either "yes" or "no." At the end of the form, I added a "register" button. Clicking on this button will submit the form. I created a separate file for submitting the form, named "submit.html." The purpose of this file is that after the user fills out all the fields in the form and clicks the register button, they will be redirected to a page displaying only 'Form is submitted.'

######CSS

I wrote CSS code to specify the style of the website I created. The purpose of writing this was to determine the overall layout of the page and the appearance of the form.

######JavaScript

I created Mocky endpoints for the Company and Subject dropdowns. The purpose of the JavaScript code I wrote is to fetch data from the Mocky API and populate the Company and Subject dropdowns.
